## 🔧 Fields in Software Engineering

| Area       | Description                 | Example Tools         |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Frontend   | Everything the user sees    | HTML, CSS, JS, React  |
| Backend    | Server logic & databases    | Node.js, Python, Java |
| Full Stack | Both frontend & backend     | MERN, Django          |
| Mobile     | Apps for phones             | Flutter, React Native |
| DevOps     | Deployment & infrastructure | Docker, AWS           |

---

## 🌍 How the Web Works

**Client–Server Model**

1. The **client** (browser) sends a request
2. The **server** receives and processes it
3. The server sends back a **response**
4. The browser displays the result

🧭 Example:
You type `www.google.com` → your browser requests the page → Google’s server sends back the homepage.

## 🧱 Frontend vs Backend

| Frontend                      | Backend                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Visible to users              | Works behind the scenes          |
| Built with HTML, CSS, JS      | Built with Node.js, Python, etc. |
| Handles design, interactivity | Handles logic, data, APIs        |

Both work **together** to form a full product.

## 🧰 Essential Tools

| Tool                          | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **VS Code**                   | Writing code                                |
| **Node.js**                   | Running JavaScript locally                  |
| **Git**                       | Version control (save & track code changes) |
| **GitHub**                    | Cloud platform for code collaboration       |
| **Terminal / Command Prompt** | Interacting with your system using commands |

# 💻 Session 2: First Steps with Code

---

## 🧠 What Is Programming?

Programming = giving **clear, step-by-step instructions** to a computer.

🧩 Example:
To make tea:

1. Boil water
2. Add tea bag
3. Pour water
4. Add sugar/milk

💡 Computers need exact steps — no guessing.

---

## 🌍 What Is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is the **language of the web**
- Runs in the **browser** and on the **server** (via Node.js)
- Used to make websites **interactive**

🧩 Example:

- When you click a button and the color changes — that’s JavaScript!

---

## ✍️ Syntax & Comments

Every programming language has **syntax** — grammar rules for writing code.

```js
// This is a comment
let message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);
```

🧠 `//` starts a comment
🧠 `let` declares a variable
🧠 `console.log()` prints output

---

## 📦 Variables & Data Types

Variables store data for reuse.

```js
let name = "Ada";
let age = 25;
let isStudent = true;
```

🧩 **Common Data Types**

- String → `"Hello"`
- Number → `42`
- Boolean → `true` / `false`
- Array → `[1, 2, 3]`
- Object → `{ name: "Ada", age: 25 }`

---

## ➕ Operators

Used for calculations and comparisons.

| Type       | Example  | Result     |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Arithmetic | `5 + 3`  | 8          |
| Comparison | `10 > 5` | true       |
| Equality   | `a == b` | true/false |
| Logical    | `&&`, `  |            | `, `!` | and/or/not |

---

## 🚀 Running JavaScript

You can run JavaScript in:

1. **Browser Console**

   - Right-click → Inspect → Console
   - Type `console.log("Hello World")`

2. **VS Code Terminal**
   - Save file as `app.js`
   - Run with `node app.js`

---

## 💪 Practice Exercises

1. Write a program that asks for your name and prints a greeting.
2. Store two numbers and print their sum.
3. Create a variable for your age and print whether you’re over 18.
