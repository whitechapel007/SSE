# 💻 Session 2: First Steps with Code (JavaScript)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Understand what programming means
- Know what JavaScript is and where it runs
- Learn about variables, data types, and operators
- Write your first real programs
- Understand how to get input and show output
- Practice problem-solving with small challenges

## 🧠 What Is Programming?

Programming means giving **exact, step-by-step instructions** to a computer.

Computers don’t think or guess — they follow **precise commands**.

🧩 Example: “Making Tea” (in human language)

1. Boil water
2. Add tea bag
3. Pour hot water into a cup
4. Add milk and sugar

If you forget a step, the computer (or you!) won’t get the correct result.
That’s why **clarity and order matter** in code.

## 🖥️ What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is one of the **most widely used programming languages** in the world.

It’s primarily used to:

- Make **websites interactive**
- Handle **logic and behavior** in browsers
- Build full web apps (using frameworks like React or Node.js)

## 🌎 Where Does JavaScript Run?

JavaScript can run in **two main environments:**

| Environment | Description                            | Example                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Browser** | Runs JS for websites (client-side)     | Chrome, Firefox         |
| **Node.js** | Runs JS on your computer (server-side) | Command line apps, APIs |

💡 We’ll use **Node.js** in VS Code for practice.

## ✍️ Writing Your First Code

In VS Code:

1. Create a new file → `hello.js`
2. Write this code:

```js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
